===================================

1)Using Promises to load study config file then a list of decks from the study file.
this is working so I'll commit to have a roll back point.

2)sort the deckxx.json files into a 'game'
	simple = simple random sample without replacement
	replace = simple random sample with replacement
	sequential = simple sample in order provided

--changes from 1.2.3

3)use only one section in the config file for the deck list

4)shuffle decks, do this after config load, before deck load 


===================================
--Feature Requests not implemented

-figure out whether the number of cards played at a time is equal to pickQty, or
	-a global variable or
	-a variable for each deck
	-errors to watch.. numbers to play should not exceed available array
-we might need to be able to shuffle all cards between decks..
	you might account for this but shuffling the final pool if that is how you serve them up.
