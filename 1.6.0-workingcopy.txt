-remove commenting from javascript on redirecting pages

\security
-rename manage to GUID

\Manage
\\study
\\\create
FIX: set focus to input box for each offer of input box

-Feature: Differentiate build time settings from run time settings with colour change

-Feature: Add Shuffle Cards within Deck for each Participant

-Feature: new instruction per deck?

-Feature: Participation Log file
  rowID, IP, Date\Time, studyName, ProlificID, STUDYID, SESSIONID, A/B Test

-Feature: A\B Testing, or ABCD, ie 
Use Particpation Log File to determine last issued AB test then issue next in list, in rotation.
i.e each new participant is assigned a test A, B or C 
this will need to work for A Only and A-Z
use 2 dimensional Array to configure, persist and to present
=================
| Test | Sets |
| A    | 1,2,3|
| B    | 3,2,1|
| C    | 2,3,1|

-line up the logs so they are all in the same order
  --IP, file, function, task, msg, data
-implement some security protocols
-Add user basic management
-port to AWS Serverless
--this may require moving to mongoDB? due data persistance changes with services
-add deck analysis? use R!
