Release 1.2.2

Work in Progress.. adding new Study Loader.. 

1)Using Promises to load study config file then a list of decks from the study file.
this is working so I'll commit to have a roll back point.

2)sort the deckxx.json files into a 'game'
	simple = simple random sample without replacement
	replace = simple random sample with replacement
	sequential = simple sample in order provided

NOTE: as per 1.2.1 the solution is not functional, this commit.. is just a role back position for dev
	
next
-use only one section in the config file for the deck list
-shuffle decks, do this after config load, before deck load 
-figure out whether the number of cards played at a time is equal to pickQty, or
	-a global variable or
	-a variable for each deck
	-errors to watch.. numbers to play should not exceed available array
