1.3.x-master
============================

## changes in 1.3.1
* all the errors created by merging 1.2.6 and 1.1.8 have been resolved
* moved study buttons down away from stimulus prompt
* changed colour or start button to green
* arranged button layout so start and submit buttons are in roughly the same spot
 when they appear, this make the UI experience smoother

## changes in 1.3.2
* remove <h2>You are finished</h2> from completion screen because the participant
must still click the link and this text may confuse them into closing the
browser. if this happens their study will not be saved to the server.
* removed studyText key:value which is now redundant in the configuration file.


1.3.3-StudyCreator
============================
## changes in 1.3.3-StudyCreator
labour time: 40hrs
Added Study Setup Feature http://uowcoglab.com/study/new
Note this still requires sence and significant amount of checking from researcher
also this is an alpha release so UI feedback when stuff goes wrong is lacking
and its a bit buggy. (like the rest of the solution)

## changes in 1.3.4-StudyCreator
* added available cards counter to study/new page to help researchers

## changes in 1.3.5-StudyCreator

## changes in 1.3.8-workingcopy

  * have completed the management module and utils modules
  * figured out problem of module paths and roots
  * plan is to add another layer in here so we can use other providers.. (later)
  * current module structure
    \routes\index.js

## changes in 1.6.2

2.0.0-workingcopy
============================
Comment: Major Structural Change, from here on we will be building decks at design time and shuffle at run time.
## changes upto 2.0.0-workingcopy
* further module Setup
* creating new study create form

EDIT: introduced JQUERY to some of the code section, replacing older code with more parsimonious version
will begin rewriting code blocks with JQUERY from this point as it reads better and is much simpler to use than vanilla javascript

Note: learn Vanilla Javascript first then JQUERY.

## changes upto 2.0.1-workingcopy
* Added pageCreate for New Blocks design- run-time module
  *  pageCreate implements 
* updated EJS Structure on OSTM2
* modules are now working effectively so we have ostm and ostm2 versions which can be accessed at the same time, this provides a methology to add completly new tests later.
* have completely re-writter studyCreate.js and the route to match
  *  new page/create POST route picks the cards from BLOCKS into sets and saves them in the config file at design time only shuffling will take place at run-time for ostm2

Note: OSTM remains on the old model and ostm2 is fork where new development is taking place. once excepted ostm will be removed and ostm2 renamed to ostm.

## changes upto 2.0.2-workingcopy
* got custom state and template engine working /ostm2/data/config/statFlow.json
  I probably should have gone with REACT and REDUX though

* User browses to /ostm2/study?studyName=20190101-jb957-stroop01&PROLIFIC_PID=GUID01.... etc
Base.ejs page is rendered and original query string is passed along to the client by rending a script tag containing data stored in the footer withing <script>, and a default view of 0 is issued.
if the post is success then the pageContent will be updated with the pageView just requested
an ajax call is made to /API/page to collect the page content
finally an ajax script get will activate this pages load functions if needed

## changes upto 2.0.3-workingcopy
* Refering to notes on 2.0.2-workingcopy about going with REACT\Redux, I've spent a few days on React Crash course, and while React looks good, it is overkill for this site and requires running both a nodejs and react server, meaning a config change on NGINX and basically excessive re-achiterure.
* bouyed by the fact that react, vue, and angular are all able to update the client DOM at managed to figure out that mearly injecting html with innerHTML wont work and that I need to add HTML elements to bind them to the DOM as anything more than dumb text (not able to work with)

#### IMPORTANTLY
1. I have managed to be able to create initiate a state data structure, open a html template page, then 
add content to the page based on the state.
2. I have therefore created a bespoke singlepage website, with simple state management, using only nodejs\express\ejs, 
  * ostm2/base.ejs                         renders wrapper HTML Template /ostm2/study
  * ostm2/index.js                         express routering for 
  * ostm2/data/config/stateflow.json       State Management Object
  * ostm2/pages/*.html                     pageContent files, contain each rendered pages content
  * ostm2/public/static/main.css           css for base.ejs wrapper
  * ostm/public/static/main.js             main Javascript that controls pageContent\css\script Loading\unloading

* in the next version, I'll work on page transition to the next item in the stateflow and unload the old script\css before loading the new.
* Converted this document from .txt to .md Markdown

## changes upto 2.0.4-workingcopy
* added consent and instructions page
  * Need to work on saving results from these
* started adding study page

## changes upto 2.0.5-workingcopy
* making the stateflow work, there are a lot of structural changes in this update that will need to be examined to understand... thats my lazy way of saying, im tied and a lot has changed but Im getting closerto to it working under the new model.

## changes upto 2.0.6-workingcopy
* views through to study(3) inclusive are working but study view needs to be coded now 
* css is handled, I can start the major job of re-working the study into this new model

## changes upto 2.0.7-workingcopy - 18th Feb 2019
* Now working on the old structure (no between set pages) again, but with the new page layout and view model implement.
* This now needs a fair bit of testing, to debug and apply appropriate error handling, and logging, however that will be deferred and implemented once the new study structure is implemented —coming up next— which will include between set pages.

## changes upto 2.0.8-workingcopy - 19th Feb 2019
* coded loadStudy()
* and also make sure shuffling at run time functions are updated.
  * shuffle cards within sets
  * shuffle cards across sets
  * shuffle sets in a block
  * shuffle blocks in study

# Changes upto 2.1.0-workingcopy - 19th Feb 2019
* setup block and set structure
  * change refresh rate per block
  * shuffling -> blocks, sets per block, stimulus within sets, and across sets per block.
  * Per Block -> changes to refresh rate and insert post-block pages if configured
  * removed ostm original and renamed ostm2 to ostm

# Changes upto 2.1.1-master - 19th Feb 2019

* workingcopy will now merged to master

# Changes upto 2.1.2-workingcopy - 22nd Feb 2019

* Feature: Differentiate build time settings from run time settings with colour change
* Feature: Add Shuffle Cards within Deck for each Participant
* re-add logging to express routes


## In progress
