============================
1.3.x-master
============================
q:)---changes in 1.3.1
-all the errors created by merging 1.2.6 and 1.1.8 have been resolved
-moved study buttons down away from stimulus prompt
-changed colour or start button to green
-arranged button layout so start and submit buttons are in roughly the same spot
 when they appear, this make the UI experience smoother

q:)---changes in 1.3.2
-remove <h2>You are finished</h2> from completion screen because the participant
must still click the link and this text may confuse them into closing the
browser. if this happens their study will not be saved to the server.
-removed studyText key:value which is now redundant in the configuration file.
