<p><strong>TITLE: </strong><em>Word frequency and contextual diversity effects in short-term memory</em></p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH:</strong></p>
<p>This study is being conducted by Steven Roodenrys, Leonie Miller and Dominic Guitard from the University of Wollongong, Australia. The purpose of the research is to investigate the processes underlying verbal short-term memory.&nbsp; The experiment you will complete is looking at how our ability to recall a list of words is influenced by the number of times a word is used in general language and the number of different contexts in which a word is used. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>METHOD &amp; DEMANDS ON PARTICIPANTS:</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to be included in the study, you will be presented with lists of six words on the computer screen, one at a time.&nbsp; At the end of the list you have to type in the words, in the order in which they were presented; i.e., the first word first, then the second word, then the third word, etc.&nbsp; You will be presented with 32 lists in this manner (plus two practice lists) and the whole task should take approximately 20 minutes.</p>
